# Xsolla-Brazil-Checkout-Optimization-Case
Identifying payment method inefficiencies and user-level drop-off patterns using PostgreSQL &amp; SQL Analytics

#  1. Introduction
This project replicates a real-world checkout conversion problem in Brazil (BR region).
The goal is to:
- simulate traffic, payment attempts, and user behavior
- analyze conversion performance
- detect root causes for drop-offs
- produce insights that a Product Analyst/BA would present
- demonstrate SQL, data modeling, and analytical thinking

 #  2. Dataset Overview
 We created a synthetic but realistic dataset stored in PostgreSQL.
 # Tables:
- `users` - user demographics, device, registration date
- `payment_methods` - available checkout payment methods in BR
- `payments` - simulated transactions (success/fail, method, device, date)
